This Java program simulates an ATM interface that allows users to interact with a bank account by performing basic operations like withdrawing, depositing, and checking the balance. The program is built around two main classes: BankAccount and ATM. The BankAccount class manages the account balance, providing methods to deposit and withdraw money, as well as to check the balance. It ensures that withdrawals are only processed if the requested amount is valid and within the available balance. The ATM class acts as an interface between the user and the bank account, allowing users to make deposits, withdrawals, and check their balance through a simple text-based menu. The Menu() method displays options for the user to choose from, and continues to loop until the user selects the exit option. In the ATMInterface class, the main method initializes a BankAccount object with an initial balance of 0, and an ATM object is created to handle user input and interaction. This program models basic functionality found in real ATMs with user input validation and continuous interaction until the user chooses to exit.
This Java program calculates the total marks, average percentage, and corresponding grade for a student based on marks obtained in multiple subjects. The program first prompts the user to enter the number of subjects and then collects the marks for each subject, assuming a maximum score of 100 per subject. It computes the total sum of the marks and calculates the average percentage by dividing the sum by the number of subjects. Based on the percentage, the program assigns a grade using a simple grading scale: 'A' for 90% and above, 'B' for 80-89%, 'C' for 70-79%, 'D' for 60-69%, and 'F' for below 60%. Finally, it displays the total marks, average percentage, and the student's grade.
This Java program is a simple number-guessing game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The player is given a maximum of 10 attempts to guess the number. After each guess, the program provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low. If the player guesses correctly within the attempts, they are congratulated and earn points based on the number of remaining attempts. If the player fails to guess the number within 10 tries, the correct number is revealed. After each round, the player can choose to play again or end the game. The total number of rounds and the player's score are displayed at the end of the game.
